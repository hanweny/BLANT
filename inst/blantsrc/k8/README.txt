WARNING: Making the k=8 canonical mappings takes 1-2 MONTHS of single-core CPU time on 2017 hardware
The only way to do it in a reasonable amount of time is to perform it in parallel.
On a machine with 64 cores it takes a few days.
Read through the script sift.sh for the k=7 test case and when you're feeling spunky, try it for k=8.
Or just download the k=8 files from http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wayne/BLANT
